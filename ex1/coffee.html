Coffee is a beverage brewed from the roasted and ground seeds of the tropical evergreen coffee plants of African origin
<br>Coffee is one of the three most popular beverages in the world (alongside water and tea) and one of the most profitable international commodities
<br>Though coffee is the basis for an endless array of beverages, its popularity is mainly attributed to its invigorating effect, which is produced by caffeine, an alkaloid present in coffee
